        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or
        in other media.

    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
      <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section.</li>
      <li>
        External- by using a link element to link to an exteranl CSS file.
      </li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. however,
        <span class="highlight"
          >in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span
        >, because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </h3>
    <p class="small">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the elements.
    </p>
    <p class="it">
      There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used
      are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
      be applied
